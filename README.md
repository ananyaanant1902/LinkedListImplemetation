# LinkedListImplemetation

implementation.java
/*
* Implementing Linked List:
* Steps:-
* 1. Creating a node class which has two fields:
*          a. Data and b. Next(pointer/reference)
* 2. Creating a class LinkedList (or any name)
*    creating a field head of type Node, thus having null pointer to it
* 3. In the main function we can make 1 linkedlist object
*    and add the first data to it's head
* 4. After that creating few nodes for the same and make each other's pointers to refer to next one till
*    last one where the pointer will refer to null.
* 
* 
* //////////
* For printing we make a function with the name display and run a while loop
* in which the untill the head is not null, we will print  it and move forward
* 
* ///////////
* quick note: 
* Keep the functions and classes on default to avoid the static/non-static error
*
* */
